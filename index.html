      <h2>Why HBO ICT suits me</h2>
      <p>
This is my opinion on why the HBO ICT program fits me.<br><br>
I believe the ICT field offers many opportunities, because there are always so many new developments and possibilities within ICT.<br><br>
I think HBO ICT suits me because I genuinely like this line of work. I already graduated from a school in this field, so I have a good foundation.<br><br>
Now I want to go further and learn programming, because I really want to improve, help people with my knowledge, share my experience, and do what I love every day.

    <h2>Why i chose HBO-ICT</h2>
  <p>
I never really liked programming in the beginning, but I chose this study because I wanted to learn more about it.<br>
Now that I need to make this website, I find it so much fun to build and program it using my own code.<br>
It's something I really enjoy, and I am happy that I continued learning and challenged myself to get better at it.
